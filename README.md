## Overview
This is my solution to the Product Preview Card Component challenge from Frontend Mentor.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hover over the buy button, adjust the dimensions of the component and it wll responsively adjust.

## My process
1. Structure out the web page using HTML
2. General CSS styles
3. More targeted CSS styles

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Challenges
1. Getting the image to shirnk correctly with its container and the rest of the product preview has been difficult.
2. There seems to be a darker green missing from the style guide (for the hover over the buy button), but I could also be missing something.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). MDN is always a reliable resource wehen it comes to Front-end Web Development.
